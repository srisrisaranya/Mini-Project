# Title of the Project :

# Smart Expense Assistant: An AI-Based Approach to Expense Control and Wealth Creation

## Small Description :

The Smart Expense Assistant is a desktop-based application designed to help users efficiently track, analyze, and control their daily expenses while improving savings through intelligent insights and budget monitoring.

## About :

Smart Expense Assistant is an AI-based expense tracking system developed to simplify personal finance management. Traditional expense tracking methods rely on memory, manual notes, or limited mobile applications that often ignore offline and cash-based expenses. This project overcomes these limitations by providing a unified platform where users can record both online and offline expenses, set category-wise budgets, and monitor savings effectively.

The system uses heuristic and statistical analysis techniques to study user spending behavior and generate meaningful insights. With a simple desktop interface and offline data storage, the application ensures privacy, usability, and reliability while supporting better financial decision-making.
